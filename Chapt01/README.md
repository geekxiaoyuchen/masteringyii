# 第一章：Composer,配置,类,路径别名

Before diving into Yii Framework 2, we need to take a look at how it is installed, how it is con gured, and what the core building blocks of the framework are. In this chapter, we'll go over how to install the framework itself and prebuilt applications via a package management tool called Composer. We'll also cover some common configurations of both Yii Framework 2 and our web server, including making our applications aware of the environment they are running on and responding appropriately to that environment.


在正式开始学习Yii框架之前，我们需要先来看看Yii是如何安装，如何配置，核心模块有哪些。在这章，我们将讨论如何安装Yii框架并且通过一个叫Composer的包管理工具来构建应用。我们还将讨论一些Yii2和Web服务器通用的配置，包括配置应用程序运行环境等。
